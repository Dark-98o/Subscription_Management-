# Subscription Management

## Project Description

A smart contract implementation for managing recurring payment subscriptions on the Stacks blockchain. This contract enables users to create subscriptions with specified payment amounts and durations, and process recurring payments automatically. The system tracks subscription status, payment history, and total revenue, providing a foundation for subscription-based services in the Web3 ecosystem.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize subscription-based business models by leveraging blockchain technology to create transparent, decentralized, and automated recurring payment systems. We aim to eliminate intermediaries, reduce transaction costs, and provide users with complete control over their subscription data while ensuring seamless payment processing for service providers.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Transparency**: All subscription data and payment history stored on-chain
- **Automation**: Self-executing smart contracts for recurring payments
- **User Control**: Subscribers maintain full ownership of their subscription data
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced fees compared to traditional payment processors
- **Global Accessibility**: Borderless subscription services without geographical restrictions

## Future Scope

### Phase 2 Development
- **Multi-tier Subscriptions**: Support for different subscription levels (Basic, Premium, Enterprise)
- **Flexible Payment Schedules**: Weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual payment options
- **Grace Period Management**: Configurable grace periods for missed payments
- **Subscription Pausing**: Ability to temporarily pause/resume subscriptions

### Phase 3 Enhancements
- **Token Integration**: Support for SIP-010 fungible tokens as payment methods
- **Discount Systems**: Promotional codes and loyalty-based discounts
- **Refund Mechanisms**: Partial and full refund capabilities
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive revenue and subscriber analytics

### Phase 4 Advanced Features
- **Cross-chain Compatibility**: Support for multiple blockchain networks
- **DAO Governance**: Community-driven subscription parameter management
- **NFT Integration**: Subscription NFTs as proof of membership
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API for easy integration with existing applications

### Long-term Vision
- **Subscription Marketplace**: Platform for discovering and managing multiple subscriptions
- **DeFi Integration**: Yield farming for subscription deposits
- **AI-powered Insights**: Predictive analytics for churn prevention
- **Mobile SDK**: Native mobile app development tools

### Contract Functions

#### Core Functions

1. **`create-subscription`**
   - **Purpose**: Creates a new subscription for a user
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `amount` (uint): Payment amount in microSTX
     - `duration` (uint): Payment interval in blocks
   - **Returns**: `(response bool uint)`

2. **`process-payment`**
   - **Purpose**: Processes recurring payment for existing subscription
   - **Parameters**: None (uses tx-sender)
   - **Returns**: `(response bool uint)`

#### Read-only Functions

- **`get-subscription`**: Retrieve subscription details for a user
- **`get-total-revenue`**: Get total contract revenue
- **`is-payment-due`**: Check if payment is due for a subscriber

### Error Codes

- `u100`: Owner only operation
- `u101`: Subscription not found
- `u102`: Subscription expired or payment not due
- `u103`: Insufficient payment
- `u104`: Invalid amount (must be greater than 0)
- `u105`: Subscription already exists for this user
